DSA AI/ML CAPSTONE PROJECT

1	  Project Overview

Objective: To predict the market prices of agricultural products using historical data and machine learning algorithms.
Steps to Implement the Project

2.	  Data Collected

• Data Sources:
 Sources: Gather data from reliable sources such as:
 Government agricultural departments
 Market reports
 Agricultural commodity exchanges
 Online APIs (e.g.,(https://www.kaggle.com/code/rjayshree/agricultural-products-sale-analysis-prediction/notebook), FAO)

• Data Points: Collect data on:
• Historical prices
• Weather conditions
• Crop yield
• Supply chain factors
• Economic indicators

3.	  Data  Preprocessing
• Cleaning: Handle missing values, remove duplicates, and clean anomalies.
• Transformation: Normalize or standardize features as needed.
• Feature Engineering: Create new features that might help in prediction (e.g., moving averages, seasonal indicators).

4.    Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
  
• Visualize the data to identify trends, patterns, and correlations.
• Use graphs like line plots, histograms, and scatter plots to analyze relationships between features.

5.    Model Selection
o Choose appropriate machine learning algorithms such as:
o Linear Regression
o Decision Trees
o Random Forest
o Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM)
o LSTM (for time series data)
o Split the dataset into training and testing sets (e.g., 80/20 split).


6.    Model Training
 Train selected models using the training dataset.
 Use cross-validation to ensure the model's robustness.

7.    Model Evaluation
 Evaluate the model using metrics like:
 Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
 Mean Squared Error (MSE)
 R-squared value
 Compare results from different models to find the best performer.

8.    Hyperparameter Tuning
 Optimize model parameters using techniques such as Grid Search or Random Search.

9.    Deployment
 Deploy the model using web frameworks (e.g., Flask, Django) or cloud services (e.g., AWS, Azure).
 Create a user interface for users to input data and receive price predictions.

10.    Monitoring and Maintenance
 Continuously monitor model performance and update with new data.
 Set up alerts for significant deviations in predictions.

•Tools and Technologies
 Programming Language: Python
 Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, TensorFlow/Keras (for deep learning)
 Database: MySQL, PostgreSQL, or NoSQL options like MongoDB
 Deployment: Docker, Heroku, or cloud platforms like AWS

Conclusion
This project can greatly benefit farmers, traders, and policymakers by providing insights into price trends, helping them make informed decisions.
